Problem - There is a restaurant with a single chef. You are given an array customers, where customers[i] = [arrivali, timei]:

arrivali is the arrival time of the ith customer. The arrival times are sorted in non-decreasing order.
timei is the time needed to prepare the order of the ith customer.
When a customer arrives, he gives the chef his order, and the chef starts preparing it once he is idle. The customer waits till the chef finishes preparing his order. The 
chef does not prepare food for more than one customer at a time. The chef prepares food for customers in the order they were given in the input.

Return the average waiting time of all customers. Solutions within 10-5 from the actual answer are considered accepted.

Intuition - Customer Arrival and Service: Each customer arrives at a certain time and takes a certain amount of time to be served.
Tracking Service Time: Keep track of the time when the previous customer finished being served.
Waiting Time Calculation: The waiting time for each customer is the difference between the end of the previous service and the customer's arrival time, plus the service time.
Average Waiting Time: Sum the waiting times and divide by the total number of customers.

Approach - 
1.Initialize Variables:
total_waiting_time to store the total waiting time of all customers.
current_time to keep track of when the current customer finishes being served.

2.Iterate Through Customers:
For each customer, check if the current time is less than the customer's arrival time. If so, update the current time to the customer's arrival time.
Calculate the waiting time for the current customer as the difference between the current time and the customer's arrival time, plus the service time.
Update the current time to when the current customer finishes being served.
Add the waiting time of the current customer to total_waiting_time.

3.Calculate Average Waiting Time:
Divide total_waiting_time by the number of customers.

class Solution {
    public double averageWaitingTime(int[][] customers) {
        double total_waiting_time=0;
        int current_time=0;
        for (int []customer : customers) {
            int arrival=customer[0];
            int service=customer[1];
            if (current_time<arrival) {
                current_time=arrival;
            }
            int waiting_time=current_time-arrival+service;
            total_waiting_time+=waiting_time;
            current_time+=service;
        }
        return total_waiting_time/customers.length;
    }
}
