Problem - Given an integer array arr, return true if there are three consecutive odd numbers in the array. Otherwise, return false.

Intuition - The problem requires checking if there are any three consecutive odd numbers in the given array. This can be solved by iterating through the array and 
maintaining a count of consecutive odd numbers. When the count reaches three, we return true. If we encounter an even number, we reset the count.

Approach - 1.Initialize a counter count to 0.
2.Iterate through each element in the array.
3.For each element, check if it is odd:
4.If it is odd and count is less than 2, increment the count.
5.If it is odd and count is 2, return true since we have found three consecutive odd numbers.
6.If it is even, reset the count to 0.
7.If the loop completes without finding three consecutive odd numbers, return false.

class Solution {
    public boolean threeConsecutiveOdds(int[] arr) {
        int cnt=0;
        for (int i=0;i<arr.length;i++) {
            if (arr[i]%2!=0) {
                cnt++;
                if (cnt==3) {
                    return true;
                }
            } else {
                cnt=0;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
